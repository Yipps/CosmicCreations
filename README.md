# CosmicCreations

Cosmic Creations is an interactive educational installation about space and solar systems. It uses Leap Motion hand tracking technology to allow users to build planets and solar systems entirely through gestures. After users generate celestial bodies, their mass and location will have various impacts on system such as determining planetary atmosphere, warping space-time, and celestial motion. Ideally this project will be displayed in a museum or planetarium, targeting late middle to high school students allowing them to have fun while learning major physics concepts.
